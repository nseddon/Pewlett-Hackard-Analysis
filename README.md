## Summary:

The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight.

- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
